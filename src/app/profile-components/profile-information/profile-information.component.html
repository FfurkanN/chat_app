      Anakin Skywalker was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi
      Knight of the Galactic Republic and the prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi
      Order, destined to bring balance to the Force. Also known as "Ani" during
      his childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear" from his
      accomplishments in the Clone Wars. His alter ego, Darth Vader, the Dark
      Lord of the Sith, was created when Skywalker turned to the dark side of
      the Force, pledging his allegiance to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious at the
      end of the Republic Era.
